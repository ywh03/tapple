# Tapple

This project was made with React.

## Rules

In tapple, a category is provided at the top of the page. Two players would take turns thinking of something belonging to the category that starts with a letter that has yet to be used, and then either click the letter using the cursor or press the letter on the keyboard to use it up. The first player to be unable to think of anything with the letters that have yet to be used loses the game.

## Controls

Press the "Reset Category" button to change the category. Press the "Reset Game" button to start a new game. Press the "Pause Game" button to stop the timer and then "Resume Game" to continue the timer.
